<BACKUP>
docker-compose exec mariadb sh -c 'exec mysqldump --all-databases --add-drop-database -u"$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_PASSWORD"' > ./dump.sql

----
Going into depth this command does a couple things:

Docker-compose launches a temporary shell onto the MariaDB container to start work
It runs mysqldump on the server with two specific options --all-databases and --add-drop-database these are important since they ensure that when the backup is restored old data doesn't get overlapped with new data.
The output of mysqldump is piped into a dump.sql file. This is your backup

<RESTORE>
docker-compose exec -T mariadb sh -c 'exec mysql -u"$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_PASSWORD"' < dump.sql

----
Docker-compose launches a temporary shell onto the MariaDB container to start work
Using the mysql command we restore the dump through a pipe
